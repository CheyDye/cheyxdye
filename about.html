          <p class="bio">My name is Cheyenne Gold. I am a multi-disciplinary artist based in the Great Toronto Area (Tkaronto) with a visual arts focus in paintings and murals. My studies and dance art practice for over 15 years in Hip Hop is the primary influence for my progressively developing style of visual storytelling through movement, colour, and social realism artwork. I hope you are able to travel back in time to an empowering and revolutionary place through the textile-, patterning-, and urban-inspired works I create to honour the pioneers of street art and beyond. Thank-you for visiting my online gallery. I hope to connect with you soon.</p> -->
